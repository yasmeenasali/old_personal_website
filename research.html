									<h3>Resonant Excitations in Exotic Compact Objects</h3>
									<h4>National Dutch Institute for Subatomic Physics (Nikhef)</h4>
								</header>
								<p>
									This past summer, I worked with at Nikhef on simulating resonant modes in the gravitational waveforms of exotic compact object (ECO) mergers. These objects are alternatives to black holes that may have similar masses and densities, but without a horizon, such as boson stars. ECOs have not yet been observed, but one method of distinguishing them from classical compact objects predicted by general relativity is studying gravitational wave signals. When the gravitational wave frequency during inspiral matches the internal resonant frequency of an ECO, quasinormal modes can be excited, resulting in a jump in orbital phase relative to point particle phasing. We implemented a new generalized ECO waveform into LIGO’s algorithm software LALSuite and then performed parameter estimation and model selection to see whether ECO features were detectable with current detector sensitivity. We found that resonances with resultant phase shifts of order unity or larger can produce detectable events using a background-foreground approach for model selection. We have since applied our analysis method to detections from the GWTC-1 catalog and submitted a paper on the results to PRD.

									<h3>The Advanced LIGO Timing System</h3>
									<h4>Columbia Experimental Gravity Group (GECo)</h4>
								</header>
								<p>
									 Prior to the start of LIGO’s third observing run (O3) in April of this year, I wrote a program that performs real time, continuous diagnostics with alerts for system failures on two of the timing subsystems. I also worked at the LIGO Hanford Observatory during January of this year to prepare for O3, collaborating with LHO scientists on checking the hardware of the timing system and studying the success rate of the interferometer locking mechanism. Throughout O3, I’ve performed checks and published internal LIGO documents on timing data for all open public alert candidates, as well as long term diagnostics for the duration of the run.

									<h3>Low-Latency Algorithm for Multi-messenger Astrophysics (LLAMA) Subthreshold Searches</h3>
									<h4>Columbia Experimental Gravity Group (GECo)</h4>
								</header>
								<p>
									 I have been working with the LLAMA pipeline to find coincident gravitational-wave and high energy neutrino candidates using data from LIGO and IceCube. Our group is currently adapting the pipeline to search subthreshold data from LIGO/Virgo's third observing run for coincident triggers and have helped generate background distribution for our study.

									<h3>Dark Matter Annihilation in the Galactic Center</h3>
									<h4>Instituto de Astrofísica, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile</h4>
								</header>
								<p>
									 In the summer of 2018, I worked at the Instituto de Astrofísica at PUC on dark matter annihilation analysis software for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). We used simulated data from the first CTA Data Challenge and wrote a program to determine the sensitivity of the CTA to gamma-rays produced by hypothetical dark matter annihilation in the galactic center. Using gammapy and Sherpa, I wrote a first look spatial analysis using iterative image fitting that searched for a dark matter residual with just one year of data. I also gave feedback to the gammapy developers that resulted in updates to the package’s background estimators.
